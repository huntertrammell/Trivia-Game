# Trivia-Game
A timed trivia game that will provide a set amount of questions for the user to answer within specified time frame. The purpose of this game is to show how I can handle using jQuery DOM manipulation and setTimeout() events in JavaScript. The page will keep track of wins v. losses & round without refreshing the page.

To begin player will select `BEGIN` and has to answer a set amount of questions within the time frame specified on the `scoreboard` card.

Once timer runs out or choice is made the choice that is selected will be taken as user input.

    If Correct/Incorrect/No selection, user will be greeted with a win/loss message and the answer will be shown.
