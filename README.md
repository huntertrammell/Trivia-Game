# Trivia-Game
A timed trivia game that will provide as many questions as the user can answer within specified time frame. The purpose of this game is to show how I can handle using setTimeout() events in js and also showcases some delicious css styling and animations - both hand-rolled and using Bootstrap. The page will keep track of wins v. losses without refreshing the page.

To begin player will select `Play` and needs to answer as many questions as they can before time runs out (clock time has been extended to compensate for animations).

User cannot change answer after selecting so they will need to think fast and decide on a proper answer before clicking.

After clicking user will be notified if answer is correct.

    If Correct/Incorrect, user will be greeted with a win/loss message and the answer explanation will be shown. 
    A variable will hold the score until end of game and reveal in a stats summary with option to play again.

Assets used in this project have been modified from their original verison to fit this applicaiton. The rights reside with the respective artists.

Sources used for research on animations, styling, and logic are included in comments but a list of all sources used can be found here with there corresponding doc & line number:
